# About 
I'm interested in psychological anthropology, social
psychology, or anything to do with an anthropology of the emotions; but from a cognitive standpoint. 
There will be some maths here and there, and hopefully, a few
simulations. 

Posts should come out every Sunday from now on. If you've got comments, feel free to drop me a mail.
